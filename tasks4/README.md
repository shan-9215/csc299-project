# tasks4 – OpenAI Chat Completions Summarizer

This project uses the **OpenAI Chat Completions API** (`gpt-5-mini`) to summarize paragraph-length task descriptions into short phrases.

## How to Run
1. Set your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   uv run tasks4

The program will summarize multiple paragraph-length tasks and print short summaries for each.
