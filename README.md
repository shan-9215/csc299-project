# CSC299 Final Repository

This repository includes all coursework completed for CSC299. It contains Tasks 1–5 as well as the final project. Each section shows a different stage of learning how to use AI coding tools, write and run tests, work with command-line applications, and develop software step by step.

## Repository Structure

**tasks1**  
Basic task manager using simple JSON storage.

**tasks2**  
Improved JSON structure and more complete command-line commands.

**tasks3**  
Working CLI with multiple commands and a pytest testing setup.

**tasks4**  
Project using the OpenAI API to summarize long text.

**tasks5**  
Spec-kit generated template for a more complete task manager.

**final**  
My full final project. Includes:  
- task manager  
- notes system  
- search functions  
- AI planning command  
- JSON storage  
- full suite of pytest tests  

## How to Run the Final Project

Inside the repository, run:

`uv run final`

This will start the main command-line program and show all available commands.

## Development Summary

A detailed write-up explaining my development process can be found here:

`Summary/SUMMARY.md`

This includes how I used AI coding tools, what went well, what did not, and how the project progressed.

## Final Video

A link to my project demo video is stored here:

`video/video.txt`

The text file contains the YouTube link to the final walkthrough.
